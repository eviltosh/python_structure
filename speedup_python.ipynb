    "# Introduction\n",
    "# multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to \n",
    "# the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency\n",
    "# , effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. \n",
    "# Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.\n",
    "# It runs on both Unix and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The multiprocessing module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in the threading module.\n",
    "# A prime example of this is the Pool object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the execution \n",
    "# of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism).\n",
    "# The following example demonstrates the common practice of defining such functions in a module so that child processes\n",
    "# can successfully import that module. This basic example of data parallelism using Pool"
